The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it.What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.Much of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal.The gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).In brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "May Very Well Be The Finest Video Game Ever Released.", "unixReviewTime": 1018051200, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2002"}

One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the \"Collector's Edition\" (\"Zelda 64 a Remake?\" and and one on the \"Regular\" edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.Mike London, 9-9-2012-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This commentary on \"Ocarina of Time\" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007Article 1: Does \"Zelda 64\" really live up to all the hype?[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?One reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]What did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.[Spoiler Finished]Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That's one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn't believe they did that!  Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.[May 9, 1999.  An article originally written for NintendoLand.com.  I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2).  It will have to be edited.

It has never appeared on Amazon.]Zelda 64 a Remake?[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )The real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same.7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker.13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?", "unixReviewTime": 1193961600, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2007"}

Many have been tempted to call it the best game ever (just read some other reviews) but I would step back from that.  It is still one of my favorite games, despite the fact that I play mostly RPG's.  By the way, Zelda is not an RPG, even though you do talk to people and have a sword.In Zelda you play as Link (Zelda is the princess, not the main character) as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil Ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples.  You change between times, where you are adult or child Link, and you have to switch often, and do different things in both, and each time has different weapons and items.  The time-traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts.The real-time combat is a lot of fun, and fairly well put together.  It involves a 'Z-targeting' system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it.  The fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result.  Z-targeting is not perfect, but it works well.The dungeons are all awesome, and very unique.  Each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon, its own gimmick, but despite that they really don't seem forced, and stay fresh all the way through (although, the last couple dungeons aren't nearly as long as the others, almost like the designers started getting bored).  For the most part the dungeons aren't too difficult if you know what to do, but it is very easy to get stuck if you don't, and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do, especially on side quests, so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful.The overall story isn't too great (for the most part, \"save the princess\"), but many of the individual events and side stories are neat.  The characters and different races which populate the world are cool, especially the Gorons, which are one of the best races ever.  The bosses of each dungeon are awesome, as well as being original, and can usually be beaten by hacking them up, or through the use of special tactics.  It's always good to have a choice.Despite how good it is, Zelda isn't perfect.  The graphics, for example, are nice, but they are old, and on the N64.  The music is okay, but mostly just ambient, and the classic Zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing.  Having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying, even if there isn't really a better system available.  Some would say Zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness (I would tend to disagree).  And of course, the fairy is annoying, but no reason to like the game any less.All in all, Zelda is a great game, and a must buy for any N64 owner, as it is one of the best Action/Adventure games ever.  If you are looking for an RPG, look elsewhere.  This isn't one.  And be prepared to get a little frustrated.  Zelda is pretty long, especially if you do everything there is to do.  Maybe 25-30 hours if you run straight through, but  it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do, or how often you get stuck.

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield.

You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.Gameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASKThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf's in this game, because it revolves around Majora's Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.Sound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.Graphics: Same As Ocarina of TimeDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn't mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.Gameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games. You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same, just different. The game is fun and a great challenge.

It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo.  The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them.  Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic.  It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console.  The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard) are unbelievable.  Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game.  This game is pretty old and pretty cheap(I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop)so it won't be hard to find.  This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of.  The game is very well made as you play through a huge world...well not that huge..  And I will say this..(I may be exagerating this though) But the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the best \"boss battle finale\" ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb.  There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean, houses anything cause it looked so beautiful.  I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look.  Nintendo scores big with the graphics.  The gameplay is magneficent.  I loved how it was all made and done.  I really can't get into this one, you'll just have to play this part for yourself....The sound is..My god...It's beautiful I even downloaded all the songs.  I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well.  The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT!  As I've stated the story in this game is just plain good, though it obviously has the \"save\" themed plot as you all know and I won't really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about..Sure the game is old and outdated, I guess..But so what..The game is still one of the greatest games of all time.  I'll put it in simple words for you, the game is flawless!  The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in, the gameplay is fun and classic(as well as riding Epona the horse)and music is just plain beautiful, the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated before...Ocarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever made(and if it's not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made, no the best video game OF ALL TIME)....Get this game you will not regret it!5 out of 5!!!!(if I could I would give it 100000 out of 5)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The greatest game of all time", "unixReviewTime": 1101859200, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2004"}

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser.  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man.  Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game.  They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part.  There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with.  Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots.  The controls are wonderfully intuitive.  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it.  You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential.  In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task.  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game.  They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier.  One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows!  Later in the game, you will be glad you did.  Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars.  They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game.  Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword.  Don't say I didn't warn you...Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one.  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule.  These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.All in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect.  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!

{"reviewerID": "A20MDJ2Q4KL7VD", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "reviewerName": "S. Fann", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG (there is debate about this, and some argue Zelda is it's own genre) with a combination of puzzles, fighting, and racing. Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT (which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube). I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time, it's that good of a game.Graphics:For the time period, Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles. It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like. If you grew up on newer systems and PC's, these graphics will look \"blocky\" to you, but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics. Still, if you want a \"retro\" video game experience, the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.Story:The Zelda story is perfect for a video game, as the basic premise is always the same. Link, a young boy (or young man in newer games), is the reincarnated hero of time. He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.Zelda OCT molds the \"Zelda Story\" into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time. The game's puzzles become progressively more difficult, culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple. The story combines several races (Hylians, Kokiri, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora) seamlessly into one large kingdom. The enemies are varied and interesting as well. The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate, complete with twists and shocks, time-travel, and genocide. Time affects the characters, and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails. The story details are amazingly deep, to the point that pictures on someone's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character. I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the \"back story\" by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes. The main story is also amazing, with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe. It's truly a master's greatest work.Game Play:The 64 had a simple controller for fun game play. There are only a few buttons, A, B, Z, C-pad, R1, L1, joystick, and the D-pad. The D-pad isn't needed in Zelda 64. This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations. Although B always attacks and A always does \"an action\", the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do. Depending on the way your character is moving, and whether or not an item is targeted, Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks (vertical cut, horizontal slash, diagonal slash, spin attack, thrust, and jump attacks). Despite the fact that B, Z, and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves, Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired. Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response!In addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls (something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on) the game play is interesting and varied. Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword, each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons. Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield, but he also get's access to a sling shot and deku seeds, boomerang, hook shot, bow and arrows, bombs, deku sticks, deku nuts, and two impressive two-handed weapons: a hammer and a sword. These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.Although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons, the game is further varied by magic. Link can wield three types of hand magic, as well as three types of magic arrows. This adds another level of monster fighting, where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.Apart from the impressive array of weapons, Link also packs a varied wardrobe. The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion (I mean, he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap, so he obviously doesn't care about his looks), so each piece has a specific use. You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits. Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields, and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.Wait, there's still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.Summary:Zelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game. The characters are interesting, with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover. The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play. The bosses are challenging, requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.Final Note:If the 64 is too retro for you, Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics. However, the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 (understandably) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great. Additionally, there is a 3DS version, but I haven't played that so I really can't comment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Favorite Game of All Time", "unixReviewTime": 1320019200, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2011"}

There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword!Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get)Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn't bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious \"Mask of Truth\". Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up \"Majoras' Mask\".But of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn't bother to complete, but completing it does have it's merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.The bosses are great. I won't go into great detail, but I've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.The temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning.

Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.There is even a sweet element of sadness in Link's lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.The ability to customize adult Link's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.In short, this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Link's Greatest Adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

The best title for the N64 it is, beyond any doubts.- Graphics: I haven't played much N64, but, for all I know, this is the best you can get in the plataform. Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.Overall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time).

However, it wasn't until two years later that Nintendo really perfected the 3-D adventure genre with the release of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\".\"Ocarina\" is, for lack of a better word, a nearly perfect game in almost every sense.  The graphics are great (for N64 standards), the music is fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is incredibly engaging.  Much like the Mario franchise before it, the Zelda franchise (although already somewhat established on the NES and SNES) took a simple character (Mario to Zelda), put him in an interesting environment (Mushroom Kingdom to Hyrule), and pits him against fantastic enemies.Of course, perhaps the true greatness of \"Ocarina\" is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests.  While this game added more depth (riding a horse, getting items that, while not vital to the outcome of the game, will help you, etc.) than any previous game in history, it also wasn't too complicated (see \"Donkey Kong 64\").  In the game, Link has a straight-forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence...you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire.The quirkiness of the game is also charming.  Along the way, Link meets a talking tree, gets trapped inside a fish's belly, befriends the roly-poly Gorons, and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme (forest, ice, water, fire, etc.).  The first time I ever played \"Ocarina\", and every time since, I found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that Nintendo came up with for each area of the game.Finally, a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot (i.e. the reason why the \"Myst\" computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed), which \"Ocarina\" delivers superbly.  Right away, you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing Princess Zelda, defeating the evil Gannondorf, and bring peace to Hyrule again.  I know it may sound cheesy, but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword-slashing RPG with a few puzzles thrown in.Thus, I recommend \"Ocarina of Time\" to all gamers, whether young or old, beginners or experts.  The difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you, while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a \"tee\" if so desired.  So whether you want to fire up the old N64, dust off the old Gamecube (for which a version of \"Ocarina\" was released), or buy the game on the Virtual Console of your Wii, do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Greatest Adventure Game Ever Created", "unixReviewTime": 1245801600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2009"}

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London.

So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES!

Seriously I beat Tomb Raider One and Two and even Four with a heck of a lot more ease than I did with part Three. So no I would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to get.One of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets. They sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice. So I advise, if you want the secret level at the end of this game, to get a strategy guide cause 99% of the time you cannot find all the secrets on your own. The secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end, and not truly worth the bother to me. I was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that I could have cared less about a secret level and wouldn't have wanted to play it anyway.And that was another problem. How hard the ultimate boss at the end was. I thought the dragon in part two was difficult- at least when it hit me I didn't automatically lose. With the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead. It was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat. Yet I cannot say it is impossible, for I did at last beat it, but it is NEARLY impossible and will take you most likely a long while like I. What I did was the best, I got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform. I definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are close.Then I guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves. Some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me I would have encountered many, many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended Lara. It grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you cannot save anytime you like- so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtracking.Worst part of the game:Nevada- In this part all the medi packs you saved up, all the ammo you saved up before- the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can. It grew to be very difficult and I hated that part of the game. The only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodies.Best parts of the game:South America- For its lovely scenes and it wasn't impossible to beat. I also liked the dinosaurs they put in, it reminded me of Tomb Raider One all over again.And London- London was fun as well I enjoyed playing there, with what looked like the same Sphinx- like statue placed in this part as was in Tomb Raider One, except this time you don't go into this one.So- So Levels:India- Sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal Tomb Raider stuff, a little boring of a level compared to the others. The statues coming alive were pretty scary though.Anartica- Creepy part of the game. At the ending part of all Tomb Raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight- in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out- in part two she fought what looked like action figures- and now in part three she has to fight mutants. Creepy definitely. Got a little scary sometimes. And this part of the game was not too hard, but indeed I was always kept on alert with those mutants. One problem I hated in this part though was the carts- those mine carts drove me crazy I was always dying in them. Just keep working at it though, eventually you get around those corners without dying.Overall I give this game a 3.5 to a 4 star rating. It is definitely not as good as the first two, just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and Lara Croft is still a fun character to play with so I can't hate this game, but I definitely will not play it again for a long time. It is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the time.Do not think Tomb Raider Four is just as stressful and nearly impossible- Part Four is a lot better and I recommend it highly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tomb Raider Three Is Not The First In The Series You Should Play-", "unixReviewTime": 1134950400, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2005"}

Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon, especially in the way of graphics. With the expansion pak, graphics had 'almost' a Playstation 2 quality to them. It's something that showed with this game. It showed in the textures of the environments, the details of the architecture, lighting effects and other eye candy. The game was also bigger and better than any other game, with the exception of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in it's 32 meg cartridge. As you've probably read in the courtesy review, it's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime.

The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes. The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once. Plus I didn't have a controller pak. Then came the day I bought it again for my n64, nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64. The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels. Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing. I was always able to hold as many as they would let me. Such as doom, Turok, South park, Armorines, perfect dark, etc. Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps. Sure they have better graphics and frame rate. But they are all the same to be honest. Emulators sucks ass I don't care if its rgb or not. But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps's are all I got. But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much. To me it's the best looking system and has the best looking games. Turok tops it all! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of. Turok 2 is on pc and n64. The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate. Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out. In my honest opinion I wouldn't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all. Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it. The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is. They are smart and fight one another (really fun to watch) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well. The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different. My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow, Shotgun, War-blade, Razor-wind, Cerebral bore, Plasma Rifle, Mag-60, Grenade launcher, the kick ass Charge Rifle (ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS), Firestorm Cannon (like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding), Nuke, Flamethrower (The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64), and the torpedo Launcher (because you can go through water faster). Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard, sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass. Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that, that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound. The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning (I run that in low-res) and is just as good as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, The world is not enough, and Turok Rage wars. Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well. Armorines (a amazing game! Uniquely different yet just as awesome), and South Park (not many liked this game but to me it's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park!... The multiplayer is good to just don't go above 2 players.) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game. Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed. They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so. Making their games unique. Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did. Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything. Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series. I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game (except turok 3, its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap). So Turok 2 is amazing! if you want to try it get it now! on n64 or even on PC! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels! Turok is the greatest fps try them all! (your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game, the first fps on n64. Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play. Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection. Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns. Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer. Turok PC,360,ps3 I played it on 360, Runs on the Unreal Engine (which is bad ass) a great game with good weapons (Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate, I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music, awesome multiplayer [if anyone is on] and a good campaign). These are the Turok games! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable. Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it! And bring a few friends over! It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fans.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Turok 2 My childhood game!!!!

The game has numerous slowdowns even if you have an expansion pak on the N64. Not everywhere, but anytime there are a bunch of explosions or a whole horde of enemies are following you then you will have some sorta slowdown. Now onto all the pros of this game.I witnessed this game before I played it. My friends were playing it when I was like 11 or so and this game scared me to death. I thought Reptoids and Endtrails were the scariest monsters ever. Capturing children not knowing what they were going to to do to them. This game saids its rated \"M\", but you really should play this when you are a kid. It's a whole lot scarier when you're a kid. Not so much when you're an adult. Either way this game gives off a very unsettling atmosphere. If you want a mindless shooter like the original Turok this game is not for you. The antagonists actually have a story this time.The enemy AI is very realistic. The monsters react with the precise speed and vitriol that makes sense.The graphics were probably the best graphics on the N64. Again, the N64 version has slowdowns, but at the time these were the best graphics we've ever seen in a video game and I still quite beautiful in retrospect.This game also have a variety of very orginally designed monsters. The raptors and Purrlin are still here, but they are way cooler and better equiped this time. You fight genetical engineered dinosoids, zombies, Purrlin (big apelike creatures), insects, spiders, cave dwellers (The Blind Ones), worms, a fat bitch that comes near the end, and even robots. All look bad ass looking and ready to kill you.The death animations are some of the best death animations ever made in the history of video games. In this game you litteral can blow someones head off, or a limb, or a whole torso.The weapon choice is also top notch. I'm sorry, but the Cereberal Bore was the coolest weapon ever thought of. That's just my opinion. There's just nothing better than locking onto an enemies head, shooting a bore, the bore drains the cereberal fluid, and then explodes when it reaches the center. Coolest weapon ever made. The Razorwind is also cheap as hell.I really can go on and on about how good this game is.

It was like Mortal Kombat, except in a shooting-game. Blood everywhere, amazing enemies and weapons, and a good, good time. And I'll admit this; I don't actully play the Turok games. No, I'm sorry, I don't. It's not that their hard, or boring, but I don't play them...well, not without the cheats at least. As soon as I find out a new Turok game's coming, I get on the internet, go to Happypuppy.com, and find the Master Cheat. Yeah, it's pretty low, but it's fun to go in these blood-soaked shooter games. And the second one is no exception. I played this game without cheats for a few hours, made up my mind, and decided it was great, and would be even better with cheats.Half an hour later, I came back with the Master cheat in my hand, which is \"BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND\", or, if you break it down, \"BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND\". Within minutes, I had an amazing arsenal, all maps, invincibility, and more by my side. The weapons...well, let's just say the first Turok can't touch them. You have the usual knife and bow and arrow, pistol, shotgun, and the rest, but you now also have a nuke, pod layer (which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact), a machine gun (as the first had, but this one's much better), the Cerebrial Bore (the most gory weapon of all. It launches out a little ball, and it goes straight for the enemies head. When it gets there, it starts sucking and draining blood form their head, then, after 5 second, it explodes, and takes the enemies head with it), my personal favorite, the Razor Wind (a shield with sharp edges on it. You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it's path, then come right back to you. It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at; the head, the legs, and the arms), and another physical weapon, the War Blade. The name says it all.Overall, this game is a vast improvement, and is the best yet (but that might change as soon as I play \"Evolution\").

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.

Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Twisted Metal Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2013"}

The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.Allow me to explain :Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.(((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.All in all, TM3 falls flat.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that.The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it.The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore.In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of &quot;Why am I here?&quot; and &quot;Why am I playing this&quot; after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "good game", "unixReviewTime": 1062720000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2003"}

One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.Released during WCW's heyday (and roughly a few months before WCW's eventual downfall), the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s.  A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions:  WCW 1 (main-event wrestlers), WCW 2 (mid-card wrestlers), WCW 3 (opening match wrestlers), WCW 4 (Cruiserweight wrestlers), nWo White, nWo Red, and Raven's Flock.  Further, there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn, but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling (and use the controls accordingly) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game.  Players use the B button to strike, A button to initiate a grapple, the d-pad to move, and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move.  The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed.  The more \"worn down\" your opponent is, the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack.  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who's not worn down, they'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own.  So much like real wrestling, you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones (and also like wrestling, it's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent's down.)  Once your spirit meter is full, you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick (or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher's an aerial maneuver.)  The controls also allow you to run, leave the ring, block/counter an attack, dodge an attack, and set your focus on another opponent if you're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.The game has several modes:  Championship, Exhibition, and Special Modes.  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer, a friend, or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players.  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, the WCW Tag Team Championship, the WCW United States Championship, and the grand-daddy of them all, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt.)  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles aren't terribly challenging, you will need to bring your \"A\" game when competing for the higher-tiered titles (or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy, either or.)  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one's eliminated, with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match.  You're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.The upside to the game is that it's still fun to play, even 15 years later.  As I said earlier, anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in, while the subtle nuances of the game don't take much effort to figure out as you go along.  The soundtrack is limited but I don't ever think anyone confused WCW's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston (of WWE fame) has released over the years (with the only exception being Goldberg's theme.)  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released, but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time (as a reminder, this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what's available today.)  If there was one drawback from the game, it's the limited gaming options that exist.  Once you beat the championship mode, that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned.  There were no steel cage match options, tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action, and the create-a-wrestler option wouldn't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF.  Other gripes I have are that you can't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can \"Hulk up\" their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.With all that said, however, the game's fun factor makes it a legitimate \"must have\" for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship.

The wrestlers (most of them anyway) have a whole lot of moves, and they are not all the same for every wrestler. The inclusion of the \"real\" wrestlers' signature moves is very cool. One of the things I especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it. There are 62 of them --- that's a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have. A few of them are locked at the start, but they're not really that hard to unlock --- at least not with the difficulty level on \"easy.\" Several wrestlers who were later on the Legends games (Hogan, Macho Man, Sting, Bret Hart, Steiners, and others) are here. Some of the wrestlers are made-up, or at least I assume they are. The graphics are good. The wrestlers are blocky, but the \"real\" wrestlers' faces are very realistic. The play control is very good --- a lot better than the play control on World Tour. The 40-man Battle Royal is really cool. There are several different arenas, which is kinda neat but (in my opinion) doesn't really do that much for the game. The sound effects and music are (in my opinion) not great but good enough. The wrestlers don't have individual entrance music, but oh well --- no biggie (again, my opinion). There is no commentary, but that's fine with me because I always turn off the commentary on games, anyway. One of my fave game features is the Costume Change mode. This mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers' outfits on them, and lets you edit the colors of the outfits. That's fun (I think so, anyway)! You can even change the wrestlers' names, but why would you ever really want to do that (unless maybe somebody [like Giant] has changed their name in real life)? There isn't much if anything about this game that I have any major complaints about. Sure, it's dated now, but I still find it as fun as I did back in 1998 (I think that's when it first came out).

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London.

So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much.

Bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give Mario his power. To find Bowser, you must climb to the top of the tower. Each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on. Every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that Mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars.Overall, I rank the game a 9/10 for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained.

The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States. Diablo comes out for the PC. However, the biggest news is the launch of Nintendo's amazing new system: the Nintendo 64, which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller.Two games were released along with the system. There was Pilotwings 64, which was not exactly what was expected, but the other game was called the greatest game of all time (as of 1996, that is, at least in the eyes of critics) by several source. And it really was.The first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy. The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddard's Mario face. And boy does it look good! But enough with the intro. It's time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test.Answer? Yes it does. Even after five years, Super Mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendo's crowning glory (speaking from a fanboy's POV.) The character and tree designs are very outdated by today's standards, but the water is still lovely (though surpassed) and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen. Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers, but back in 1996, this game would get an A+.But who cares how it looks. Let's see how it sounds.The answer? Great! Before 1996, Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk, but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words \"It's-a me, Mario!\" and \"Hello!\" while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back. But again, this is only the intro. The question is whether games sounds that good.The answer, naturally, would be even better. Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including \"Mama mia!\", \"Here we go!\" and \"Press start to play!\" Unfortunately, everything else (other than Peach and Bowser) don't talk in anything else other than words. But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game, and if people complain for Zelda, then they shouldn't complain here.The music and sound effects are just divine. Outside the castle, you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall. Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing. Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber. The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music, and it's all wonderful.Now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way, let's get into the meat of the game: the gameplay.The first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games. There are only 1-Up mushrooms, and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning. However, Super Mario 64 is 3D, and most of those elements just wouldn't work in a 3D game.The story, according to the manual, is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake. When Mario reaches the castle, he is greeted with a gruff voice. Wondering what went on, Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in. There, he finds himself in a new world, with a giant Bob-Omb on the top. He fights and defeats it (you'll have to do that part yourself) and gets a star. Later, he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle, captured the Princess, stolen the Power Stars, and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings, then the world itself.Yeah, so it isn't much different from other Mario games, but that's not the point. The point is, there are 120 stars out there (although 70 is need to beat the game, but where's the fun in that?) for you to collect. Your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars.Well, instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games, Mario has 8 life bars. Hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars, as well falling from semi-high heights. Burning Mario's butt will make him lose 3. Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4. But don't worry. Coins and water will replenish your health. If you lose all 8 or fall down a pit, you lose a life. But for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-Up Mushrooms, you get a life.Your moves include the standard running, punching, butt-stomping, as well as the kick, the long-jump, the wall-kick, the side-somersault, and the backflip. You can also swim! There are three special caps that gives you special abilities. The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly. The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy. The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls. Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world.The Nintendo 64 controller, with its analog stick, makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully. (Just imagine travelling in a 3D world with a D-pad.) Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the C-button. It may be annoying at first, but eventually you'll get used to it, and it'll come naturally, and you'll learn to play with the bad angles.Super Mario 64 not only has good graphics, good sound, and good gameplay, but the fact that it is revolutionary (in that it brings gaming into the 3D world) makes it not only the best game of 1996, but possibly also the best game ever. That's right, even better than Castlevania and Super Metroid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Game of 1996!", "unixReviewTime": 1012348800, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2002"}

The first few passes through the first few stages were fine, and pretty fun, but the rest of the game ends up being one long, annoying, tedious, impossible, and frustrating chore.To start off, the control just isn't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game. There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B, but half the time, the controller is non-responsive. Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up, this usually means falling...over and OVER again!To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points. If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain, and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall, you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN! So if you're like me, and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work, you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!Now let's talk about the camera. Throughout most of the game, I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser. It's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time. Pressing the C buttons will move it around, but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards. If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump, this can be particularly fatal.Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump! This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for all the levels which require you to get to \"the top\" of things. Again, if you fall once, that's it, you start all over again. If the game designers weren't going to give you any continue points in these levels, why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL!!!???There are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next.

I finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed. In my opinion Super Mario 64 is the best in the Mario series and one of the best games ever. This game was a breakthrough in 3Dplatformers and it's easy to see why. The 3D is great for its time and the style is incredible.The game is addictive as well. I would play for hours and hours and wouldn't want to stop, and Super Mario 64 does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time.The plot is simple, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and Mario must save her. But the plot's not important in a video game. The game play is what matters.The game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock. Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peach's castle there are tons of areas inside. Getting to new areas is simple. You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors, and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors. Overall, there are 120 stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is.When battling Bowser in this game, I was disappointed. He's so easy. When I beat him the first time I was surprised how easy he was. It was more difficult getting to Bowser than it was battling him. But all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it.There are also hidden items, characters and power ups for Mario to find.Now there are a few problems like any other game that I think are quite frustrating. Mario's controls sometimes are a little tough. His wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again, and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas. But, despite these problems it's still a great game.This game is a must own for Mario fans. While yet you must already know this since I'm writing this review thirteen years later. : )Super Mario 64 will always be known as one of the best 3Dplatformers in video game history.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Mario 64", "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009"}

It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks", "unixReviewTime": 1151280000, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2006"}

For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.I'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game.

The first few weeks i played it, i was amazed at the beautiful 3D graphics. Honestly,  i had never seen 3D graphics before this game, so it was awesome and  inspiring.I love this game, so i'm writing this review. There are some  memorable moments from this game (like when Mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies)All in all, it  showcases the N64 incredible 3D graphics and the sound isn't half  bad.The levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook) and should take some time to crack the puzzles.  Basically, the game is quite easy and not surprisingly, it has enough  mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied. As for level designs, i think  it's excusable considering it's first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you (again) after a long absence...My gripe is while  this game is really good (i mean i'm a big-time Mario fan from the first  mario game), it's only as good as it lasts.

While i say that, it's without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.Even if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust (not likely)-i'll always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N64 lifetime (that  is 1996-2001).Anyway, every Super Mario game is groundbreaking (SMB1  created the side-scroller, SMB2 was queer and fun, SMB3 is the greatest  platform game ever, SMB4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in 3D without luigi,which is sad)But cheer up  people- the next generation is almost upon us.

The story line is interesting and the levels are big, but not as large as Banjo-Kazooie.

The games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave Bowser (you have to beat him three times) are DANGEROUS especially the last one. From the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond Mario must battle enemies in 3-d and collect six stars on every level. Five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect 100 coins on a level. The music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean.

Peavey", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "Super Mario 64 one of the greatest games for N64.Story/Plot: the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.Gameplay: Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink \"peace-loving\" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.The gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.Power ups: Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.Abilities: Mario can wall jump, long jump, and many more.Music: the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage. In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.This game is a must get in your video game collection. This game also started the trend where super games have 64 in their name for example Donkey Kong 64 Super Mario Kart 64 Pilotwings 64 and Super Man 64.Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Powerups 5/5 Overall 10/10 = A+", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Mario 64 Adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1337817600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2012"}

The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube.

It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island&quot;, stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, &quot;Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?&quot;  The answer, in the form of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, proved to be a quite emphatic &quot;YES!&quot;&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;) and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.One other aspect of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.

The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console.  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN'T SAY THAT so don't flame me!)but that's beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you'll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90's but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it's just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you've ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It's so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!  Now that I'm done ranting and talking about this game I'll just get to it quickly...The Good-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made-Loads of things to do-Not hard, but not too easy, it's juuuust about right-The game is just plain fun, the moves, the platforming, collecting, ect-Collecting stars is really fun!-The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!-Though the bosses are easy I still think they're just classics!-Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars, and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atThe Bad-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)-Some will find the graphics to be \"terrible\" or just \"bad\" which I find hard to believe-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldn't even touch the game(because the game doesn't take too long to beat for plot and if you're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with, what's the point of that?)-Some will be angry with the camera-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river, if you want a hardboss go play something els....other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever...Overall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own.  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals, superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do.  The games music was just great to listen to, the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario(though limited)are great!

First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers 3 for the NES, to Super Mario World for the SNES, and now Super Mario 64 for the N64.  The game is 5 years old now, but it's still just as fun to play as ever.  The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.As others have said, the basic story of the game is classic Mario:  Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her.  To do this, he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game.  These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle, plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself.  Although you only need 70 stars to finish the game, there are a total of 120 stars available for collection, and you won't be satisfied until you have collected each one.  The 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty, but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult.  It took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the Princess the first time.  Each level has a different theme.  Some are on mountains, some are in water-filled caves, and there is one set inside a giant clock.  My personal favorite is the haunted house level.The gameplay in Mario 64 is exceptional.  Mario has many different types of moves, ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies, to a great long jump, to a very difficult-to-master wall jump.  You must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars.  Also, there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly, walk underwater, and become invisible.  Again, all are vital for 120 stars.After you finally win, you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again.  But, such is not the case.  Even though you have all 120 stars, you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over, as much as you want.  You'll be tempted to do just that.

Nintendo was forced to cancel many Super Nintendo games (Doom FX, Star Fox 2, Mario FX) and release the Nintendo 64. Many popular 2D games failed in full 3D. Castlevania, Mega Man... they failed and have not been revived. Did Mario succeed? YES! This game is a legend. I heard about it in 2009 (not 1996) in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled \"Mario\". I did not own a Nintendo 64 (this was 2009). The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart. I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with 2000 points on it (enough for Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros 3). I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said \"HELLO!\". Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears. Then I started the game and got a message from Peach. In her girly princess voice she read the letter, which told Mario she had baked a cake for him. The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds. I had never played a 3D Mario Game. I stuck to Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, My Sims, and Wii Sports (I was 8 years old). After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle. Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser (Who ate cake, I guess). Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown. He told me (using fancy king words) that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him. I defeated him and moved on to the next level, a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces. Then I started level 3, a snow level. What a level that was! Finding baby penguins, building snowmen, sliding down a slide. Then my parents walked in. My mom said \"YUCK! What are those dots supposed to be?\". Those dots were snow flakes. My dad said \"Are those graphics... 64 bit?\" I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels. Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star. Each boss was different and interesting. The graphics are outdate, so what? This, along with Mario 3, really changed my view of video games. Now (in 2012) I have almost no respect for high-powered consoles like the Xbox 360. Kids should play these old games. How hard is it to get kids a $20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this? The challenge is not too much. If you get stuck on one level you can try another.

I had been hearing about how awesome the Nintendo 64 was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the USA release of this system. I remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming Christmas before I even saw it. Then one day I was Christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo set-up in the mall, and I finally got to see what the massive hype was about.The game was bright and colorful, and Mario was fully 3D. A large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology, and I only lingered for a moment, yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory. Mario 64 looked like nothing I had ever seen before, and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything I had ever seen on Playstation, Sega Saturn or any other system. I was very impressed.Several months later, I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario 64. I loved the game dearly back then, and to this day I still love this game. It still looks, feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era. While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphics-wise, that game is so great in it's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately.Mario 64 is a perfect launch game for the Nintendo 64 home console system. Looking at the controller for the N64, one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout. However, Mario 64 is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamer's accustomed to the new feel of the controller and it's new button layout.When I say the controls for this game are very simple, I must also mention that Mario is capable of many actions. Mario can walk, run, crawl, jump, triple jump, backflip, side somersault, wall kick, swim, climb, punch, kick, slide, fly, shoot from a cannon, butt-splash, hang, hand-over-hand, crouch, surf on koopa shells, and even look around. While this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master, the reality is that yes, it is alot but is not difficult at all to master. A few of the skills, such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master, but the majority of Mario's actions are very easy to master, which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being Mario.The camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them. You might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas (such as Boo's Haunted House) but for the most part, the camera angles are very functional. The gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve. While you only need 60 stars to complete the game, players looking to one-up the challenge can elect to try and collect all 120 stars, which requires true mastery of the game.The music is outstanding. Koji Kondo, also famous for the Ocarina of Time music, did all the music for Mario 64 and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes. My personal favorite is and will always be the Jolly Rodger Bay / Dire Dire Docks music.The level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration. Mario will find himself in sunken ships, caves with toxic gas, inside a volcano, a pyramid, in a desert, a fortress in the sky, sliding down slippery snowy slopes, and even inside a giant strange clock. This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay. I don't believe I've ever met anyone that didn't find this game fun to play.No, Luigi is not in the game. There was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock Luigi, but all proved untrue. Kind of strange Luigi wasn't in the game, but not that big of a deal.Mario 64 is well loved and remembered, but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo 64's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed. Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem, but there were other great games in the SNES library. However, with the Nintendo 64, Super Mario 64 along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo 64 library, which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top-notch games. The Nintendo 64 library just didn't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game.In the end, Mario 64 will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the Nintendo 64-bit era.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mario Kicks Off The 64-Bit Era In Style", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

Having said that, it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date, and one which all games, regardless of genre, will be judged henceforth. Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64. Look closely, Mario's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever. But videogames are, in the end, meant to entertain. And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.Like many previous Mario games, experimentation is integral to the experience of playing. You must explore everything, leave no rock unturned, no mushroom mute, no door unopened. Mario himself has so many possible movements, and the environment is so intensely interactive, that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular. The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles, although the three-pronged analog controller isn't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently. Overall, the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint. The camera, which moves on its own (unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons), tries to find the optimal angle to view the action, though occasionally you're simply not able to see where you're going. Additionally, frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge. But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on, you will execute these skills unconsciously. The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking. The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course, with numerous secret areas and bonuses, including 15 extra stars (for a total or 120 stars). It'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess (not to mention find Yoshi), so the game's replay value is bountiful. And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness, the graphics are magnificent. Shigeru Miyamoto's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish, the textures rich, and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed. SM64 is not perfect, however. Despite the efficiency of the hardware's Load Management, draw-in is noticeable, and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects. Still, this is as close to perfection a game has ever been (64-bit, no less). Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo's preference of &quot;silicon over CDs&quot; to the test, with pleasingly familiar results. Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation (or both), have by now acclimated to long load times, though grumblingly. Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be: load time is nil, and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds. From the time you switch on the unit until you're done, the flow is seamless, and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous. Nintendo's musical prodigy, Koji Kondo, turns in an inspired performance, somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world. Even though some tracks are cheesy, others, like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level, are more than effective in setting the mood for the level, and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio. Also impressive are the sound effects: Mario's onscreen antics are matched by grunts, whoops, and hollers, fleshing out his spunky personality. As a whole, the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay (or delays) imposed upon the unit's release. SM64 is complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64. Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent.

The replay value should be obvious as there is no &quot;end goal&quot; to meet, though there are &quot;rewards&quot; along the way.  There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000.  First, there are no scenarios.  That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game.  Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000).  Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited.  The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game.  Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version.  The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides.  Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings).  I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates.

Becuase it just isn' that good of a game, I'm an expert ing gaming and pcs and have been in the business since windows 95. But this game is made for the average \"dumb american\", that is why it is so simple, and lacks any depth. This game is perfect for teenagers, soccer moms, and stud people, but anybody who likes a good challenging game shouldn't even look in it's direction.These are the good things about the game....1. It has playability value but not much, from 1 to 10 maybe a 3, becuase once you master it( spoiler, it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city) you just don't give a damn about playing it again.2. System requirements are low, and it runs on the most ancient pc that is feasible.3. It's easy to learn to play, and inexpensive, and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close( highest zoom).4. You can voyage out of reality and build a city of imagination.Now these are the concerns about the game.1. The game has very little realistic qualities about it, it is not in check with the real word, even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids.2. There is no names for streets, no district and area setting, and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small, medium or large park( Different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic).3. There are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world, and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city, which is also unrealistc, since all large cities have metros.4. The max loan size is way too small, and the interest is a bit extreme.5. The airports don't generate as much income as they should.6. There are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game, and the availabe ones are very unrealistic. The train option is just horrific, and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build,( they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building, but transportation is a huge part of any city over 300,000) the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build, and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways, and no street lights and signs.7. It is just about impossible to get a city size of over 4 million even on the larget plot availabe, and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible, since the large us cities have far more than 5million people in there central part.8. The game crashes and is racked with bugs.all in all you see why this game gets a 40, if less, this game is not just that great, hopefully they will fix atleast 60 percent of these major flaws(anything less is unacceptable) in the next simcity, and as for simcity 4, lets not just go there,and there will not be a five, ( I believe maxis is not in operation anymore and has just not announced it), but the city simulation industry is still wide open and the demand is high.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent at best", "unixReviewTime": 1245456000, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2009"}

Breazeal", "helpful": [13, 16], "reviewText": "First off, let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:*Realistic 3-D environmentWrong. The game is 2D, it merely looks 3D. It IS realistic, however. There is far more detail in  2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone's  machine.*View cities from up to 50,000 feetI guess...you have 5 zoom  levels. The above implies that you can zoom to any level.*Detailed  control over businesses and other facilitiesNone whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential, commercial, and industrial areas,  along with other specialized zones. You can't micromanage any individual  businesses.*Everything and everyone movesCars and SimCitizens move,  so do some animated buildings, but certainly not EVERYTHING.*Optional  load-in sets for customization and enhancementsThat's handled much  better in SC3K Unlimited.SimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me. I love  being able to play a fully updated version of 2000, but whether it should  be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.Graphics-wise, 3000 is  beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in  individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided  entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each  feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with  to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements  of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom.Gameplay: here's the sticking point for me. If you've continued to  play SimCity 2000 until you're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for  work/school, you'll probably do the same with 3000. Given all the new bells  and whistles, it'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that. From this point, however, two camps emerge. One camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it, relishing the  freedom to create anything they want. I fall into this category. The other  camp, once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will,  are going to wonder what's the fun anymore. So depending on your  expectations for the game it'll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didn't cost 40 to 50 bucks.As for difficulty,  it's no harder really than 2000. Some of the new features like garbage  disposal, ordinances, and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex. Maxis should be commended for  that.Overall? It's good. In fact it's very good. They put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less. Is it worth the  money? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out. Get it instead, as it's much more  refined. If you haven't played a SimCity game before or if you're a diehard  2000 fan, absolutely. If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it  after a little bit, you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's better than SimCity 2000, but....", "unixReviewTime": 958521600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2000"}

The power-ups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until you're firing more powerful and voluminous attacks.I mentioned the controls before: between the D-pad, rolling with the right-shoulder button, firing special attacks with the left-shoulder and B buttons and keeping hold on the A button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo, it's fun and easy to use. That being said, the missions in Vanishing Earth aren't easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at you.However, players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if they'd like (personally, I enjoy staring over from the beginning so I can keep all the power-ups I earn). And even if you don't want to play the whole game, there's a fast 2 or 5 minute arcade-style mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the start.I had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but it's good for single player as well.

MK 4 came out in The Summer of 1997 it was the last Mortal Kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return Liu Kang, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Reptile Sub Zero & Scorpion. Goro returns which kind of pi s  s  es me off 1 he's harder than he was in MK 1 or MK Trilogy 2 he wasn't even in MK 4. You fought Quan Chi as The sub boss. Jax & Sony are back.  Some of the newer characters I didn't care for like Reiko he was a poor substitute for Noob Saibot but Noob is a secret character he has no ending though. Goro is another secret character & he has no ending so it's pretty pointless. I hate Kai. Jarek is just another poor substitute for Kano. Ilike Fujin Quan Chi Tanya is alright. Shinnok is cool to play as. Story is Shinnok escaped The Neterreln thousands & thousands of years ago Shinnok was an Elder God he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant. Raiden & Shinnok fought over it & ended with millions of people dying Shinnok was banished to The Neterreln. While The Invasion Of Earthrelm was going on Noob Saibot helped Quan Ch get Shinnok out of The Neterreln. Shinnok overtaken Edina takes Kitana hostage. Kitana is Liu Kang's love of his life all around good time girl. So Liu Kang helps Raiden. Shinnok has killed most of The Elder Gods except for A Wind God Fujin. Quan Chi & Scorpion have a history he tells Scorpion yes that Sub Zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan & his family. Also Tanya a new fighter & Reptile join to help Shinnok. Tanya's job is trap Liu Kang & have him killed & if you're seen her ending she does it's not official Liu Kang lives on until MK V. Shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him Reptile is lied to again Since Shinnok is a fallen Elder God the battle can be won by Motals. Jax & Sonya are hunting down A Black Dragon guy named Jarek & if you have beat this game as Jax it's a really bad a  s  s ending. The FMV endings look better on The PS1. It's not perfect the main boss Shinnok I Quan Chi should've been the boss instead he's in most of the endings.  Nothing wrong with Shinnok I'll say this he's better than The Dragon King or Blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters. But when you compare him to Shang Tsung or Shao Kahn he doesn't measure up. The game has a lot of in your face gore. This game got ported to The Playstation & Nintendo 64 & an expanded version called Motal Kombat Gold on The Sega Dreamcast. The 64 version has the advantage that it's a cartridge no load time but The 64 controller isn't made for fighting games. The Playstation version has better picture quality for the endings & you can get an arcade stick for it. I've never played or have Dreamcast but I've heard MK Gold is glitchy but Kung Lao, Baraka Kitana, are added I think it has Millena & Cyrax. I don't know if MAME will run it. This woulalso be the last game Of  The Boon Tobias era.

Definitely the best fighting game for the fading N64 platform. It is somewhat easy on the easy settings (almost too easy mind you), and as you increase the challenge level, the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold.The only gripe that I have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the N64 controller. My hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller (with the stick and not the pad), but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad. That will feel weird at first. You can re-map the buttons to better suite your needs, but if you do, other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well. For instance, Sub-Zero's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide. While you're doing this, you're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight?I still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run. The combo system is wonderful, and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the N64 console should pick this one up. With the price that it is at now, it is very affordable too.

I liked it, but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc, 'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that.All these years later I've just picked it up, second hand, for the N64. And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version, which is a good thing!The only difference is in the movies. The PC and I 'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form, where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves. I have no complaint about it, I like it wether it's video form, or 3D poly form. They both still tell the same story. Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.All the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight \"continues #\" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.This game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didnt wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.This game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)MK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Choose Your Destiny", "unixReviewTime": 1121817600, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2005"}

It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.While the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.MK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games. The Playstation had plenty of 2-d and 3-d fighters that made MK4 pale in comparison.

It only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode, but I suppose the fact that I'd previously played BattleTanx: Global Assault on PS1 helped me out a little.Story: Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9% of the females on planet earth. This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.Gameplay: You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank, blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing (or kidnapping???) women. Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence. Different gangs have different types of tanks. There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles, guided missiles, lasers, and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas. Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of \"Capture the Flag\" from any number of FPS games. BattleTanx's single-player is unique in that regard.Controls: They work pretty good. No complaints.Multiplayer: There's no co-op campaign. BOO! :P You can play through various types of matches (most of which resemble the single-player levels) against friends or the AI. You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player. That's all good and well, I guess, but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come. What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players.Graphics: They're early N64, but they look alright.

You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users, you can use a Turok type of control.I still gotta say that I wouldn't play it for it's story mode. Personally, I'd play it for it's multiplayer mode because that's what the game is really good at! That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes.For you parents, most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few &quot;choice&quot; phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids. For those of you that don't have to worry about that, order a pizza, call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer.

The exceptionally popular foul-mouth TV shows based on the fictional, yet epic adventures of Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and (the now removed) Kenny, four innocent little third graders (now fourth) in the snowy, mountain town of Colorado. It's a wonderful life; you have a gay teacher, a pimp-daddy chef, a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week, and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want. At least, until, killer turkeys, aliens, clones, and toys invade your town and try to take it over. YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks (or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt, but then the game's no fun).Like all shooter's, I only enjoy this game with cheats. The master cheat for this game is \"BOBBYBIRD\", or, if you break it down, \"BOBBY BIRD\". It unlocks every weapon, level, and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game.In single-player, you assume the role of either Stan, Cartman, Kenny, or who I always pick, Kyle. Each comes with their own insults and comments. As you progress, you find Kenny, Cartman, and Stan, and they come with you, but you can't play as or with them. They just allow you to hold more weapons and item (I guess that's because it's four pairs of hands). Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys; and ultimatly, the gigantic, robo-turkey. Without cheats, you start with a snowball, or you can advance it, and make it a \"yellow snowball\" (and if you've seen Jackass, you know what that is). The other weapons are a cow launcher, a toy-machine gun, and more. Sooooo much more.This game is a good game, but only if you're a fan of the TV show. Even though it would be fun if some people weren't, they'd still annoy everyone, complaining of \"bad language\" and \"foul humor\". Ignore them. If you're a fan, get this, or at least rent it.

South Park isn't a great game, but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it. You can chose between the four main characters: Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny. Usually, I pick Cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults. They implemented the same humor they use in their TV show, so the sound samples keep you the most entertained. The point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys, aliens, toys, clones, and what not. Each level gets kind of repetitive, so the game can be a little boring. There is not much variety to it, but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained. I give this game credit for the humor, sound, creativity, and graphics, but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than sound.Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 because although its cleaver and funny, the actual game play of the game is not that exciting.

I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.Overall, this game has great sound effects, music, weapons, items, charaters, abilities, an okay storyline, excellent graphics and just a really good play!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Castlevania 64 - A New Way Of Castlevania", "unixReviewTime": 1005868800, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2001"}

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game:THE GOODFinally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.THE BADI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.OVERALLNot recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!

I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days, and this is a good addition to a fine series. This is a great game, but not as good as \"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\" for Playstation.To start on a positive note, there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics. You can roam freely, battle monsters face-to-face, and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling. The control is responsive, and the buttons are easy to figure out, which is good considering the pace of the game. The 3-D worlds are huge, and are fun to explore. The sound is also excellent. You can hear the clatter of bones, the snapping of jaws, and the cracking of whips clearly, without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.The cons of this game are mostly technical, nothing to do with the graphics or storyline. First of all, the camera can be a servere pain sometimes. It often lingers when you don't want it to, and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.The control is good, but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements. I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch. Also, a map would be helpful. Certain areas look the same as others, and sometimes, I cannot tell where I have been and where I am going. But as I said, these are more technical flaws.
